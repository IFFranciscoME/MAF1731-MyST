- The Roll model

A technique to estimate the bid-ask spread. The Roll (1984) model examines this bounce in a theoretical market and determines that the negative autocovariance can be used to estimate the bid-ask spread.

the interpretation of autocovariance:

positive autocorrelation in returns, imply presence of informed traders (Probability of having a trade in the same direction after a buy\sell is higher), and dealer sets a higher spread due to adverse selection.

negative autocorrelation, a trade is likely to be followed by a trade in the opposite direction (Sell after a Buy and vice versa) and dealer does not have adverse selection risk

We expect a negative autocorrelation in high- and ultra-high-frequency (every trade) data due to bid-ask bounce
